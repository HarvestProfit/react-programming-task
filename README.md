This project gives you an API to hit that allows you to create/update/manage a few different resources, via an authenticated API.

You should [Create a React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that can:
- Handle authentication (you can create a user to authenticate with as part of the API)
- Handle the management of a logged in user's projects
- Handle the management of each project's tasks

The API given is a relatively "flat" API. The big exception is that we include all `tasks` for a given `project` in any `project`-based response, to make rendering simpler.

Each endpoint is [documented here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2582145/RWMEMTg7)
